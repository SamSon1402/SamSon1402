**Digital Craftsman (AI Developer/Calesthenic/Creator)**

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time.I have Work Experience of close to 2 years at TCS, in developing Recommendation System and GenAI Products. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "Explainmelikeiam5".
